# Cellular Savior REST API

**[CellularSavior.com](https://cellularsavior.com)** is a web application designed to help users find the best cellular plan for their needs. By allowing users to compare plans, review detailed information, and receive personalized recommendations based on usage, **Cellular Savior** ultimately aims to provide a **trusted third-party** platform for both consumers and sales representatives to discuss **optimal cellular plans** with **transparency**.

Having worked in cellular sales for five years, I've seen firsthand how people are often taken advantage ofâ€”unnecessary fees, overpriced plans, and hidden contract terms are commonplace. **Cellular Savior** seeks to change that. Our goal is to **empower** individuals to make **informed decisions** while helping sales reps align with **honest sales practices**, cutting through the opacity and deceptive tactics that plague the market.

The application is built with Vue.js, Flask, and Google Cloud Platform (GAE, Datastore, OAuth 2.0).

You can find the frontend [here.](https://github.com/BByrge/Cell-Savior)

## Running the Application

To start the application locally, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Testing the API

The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`.

Use `frontend_simulator.py` to simulate the frontend for testing and debugging purposes. This script simulates the Google OAuth flow, which isn't easily testable via Postman.

Run the "frontend" with the following command:

```bash
python frontend_simulator.py
```

The frontend simulator is available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
